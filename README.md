# JuliaPy
Julia's Fractal drawing script in Python, with great colors!
It is strongly advised to edit the script and experiment
with different values of C.
Feel free to report any interesting result :)

This was co-written with Senryaku42 during a very stormy summer night,
after a visit to Abo Le Tch√®que, brilliant mathematician who gave us the original idea.
Greetings and Special thanks to them!
