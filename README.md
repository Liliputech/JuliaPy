# JuliaPy
Julia's Fractal drawing script in Python, with great colors!
It is strongly advised to edit the script and experiment
with different values of C.<br>
Feel free to report any interesting result :)

This was co-written with Senryaku42 during a very stormy summer night,<br>
after a visit to Abo Le Tch√®que, brilliant mathematician who gave us the original idea.<br>
Greetings and Special thanks to them!
